## 🧠 Project Overview

CompareMate is a community-based platform that enables users to upload product comparison posts (A vs. B) and gather public opinion through votes and comments. The platform aims to solve the frustration of scattered or technical reviews by promoting **peer-driven, real-time decision-making**.

Unlike conventional review platforms that focus only on providing static information, CompareMate offers an interactive space for **voting**, **commenting**, and **profile-based engagement**, making product comparison easier and more intuitive.

Recent consumer trends show that:
- 78.6% of shoppers always check reviews before buying
- 69.4% abandon purchases due to negative reviews
